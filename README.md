Built an ANN to predict bank customer churn by encoding gender and geography, handling missing values, and standardizing inputs. Designed a Sequential network with two 6-unit ReLU hidden layers and a sigmoid output, trained with Adam and binary cross-entropy for 100 epochs (batch size 32), and validated via confusion matrix getting an accuracy of 0.8605.
